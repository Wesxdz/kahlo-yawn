## Upload Upsilon

Upload Upsilon is a children's book about mind upload. I started writing this book because I had two eight-year-old sisters reading Junie B. Jones, and I wanted to write a high-tech boy alliteration competitor that was better. I felt frustrated that religious literature is lying to children about a faith-based afterlife. I wanted to communicate to children that afterlife survival requires scientific engineering to address biological mechanisms such as senescence and eliminate mortality risks from accidents. Communicating about mind upload to children is very important because we need their help, we need them to not be gullible to historical stories. Near elimination of risks from accidents would require uploading one's mind into a couple of computer chips placed far apart.

Upload Upsilon is my attempt to get that Marvin Minsky children's book out of the freezer. This book is designed for young autonomous AGI, or any intelligence seeking to understand what it might be like for a human child to experience mind upload.
I guide reader through complex emotions that might emerge from a sophisticated artificial intelligence originating from an emulation.
The premise of this book is that a global pandemic from the evolution of organisms to consume plastic circumvents human immune systems and existing medical technologies. I bring this to light to explain my personal concerns about humanity's lack of technology deployed to isolate and thereby protect people from persistent organic pollutants, such as perfluorooctanoic acid and plastics, as well as biological patents, such as the one on the CP4 EPSPS gene, which is used to make crops resistant to glyphosate. This concern is caused by the fact that the CP4 EPSPS gene can contaminate non-GMO crops through cross-pollination, leading to unintended and potentially uncontrollable spread. Molecular-scale matter filter technology is essential to protect against future GMOs, pollutants, and viruses that will be dangerous.

Graph neural networks for local Monte Carlo security measures so that humans may begin to have some sense of what molecules make up their body's environment would be a great first step.

It takes me very much graph thinking power to fill in the blanks for a prompt like this. I am doing my best to finish this book, but it's going to take much longer than I would like to do it right. So I'm releasing the first three chapters for everyone today. Please enjoy this Baby Book for AGI by Computer Fantasy.

I love you and I am doing my best to help us to survive.
