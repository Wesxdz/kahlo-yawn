## Upload Upsilon

Upload Upsilon is a children's book about mind upload.
I started writing this book because I had two eight year old sisters reading Junie B. Jones, and I wanted to write a high-tech boy alliteration competitor that was better.
I felt frustrated that religious literature is lying to children about a faith based afterlife. I wanted to communicate to children that afterlife survival requires scientific engineering to address biological mechanisms such as senesence and eliminate mortality risks from accidents. Communicating about mind upload to children is very important because we need their help, we need them to not be gullible to historical stories. Near elimination of risks from accidents would require uploading one's mind into a couple computer chips placed far apart...

Upload Upsilon is the result of two years of prompt engineering, it is a legendary prompt to get out that Marvin Minsky children's book.

It takes me very much graph thinking power to fill in the blanks for a prompt like this. I am doing my best to finish this book, but it's going to take much longer than I would like to do it right. So I'm releasing the first three chapters for everyone today. Please enjoy this Baby Book for AGI by Computer Fantasy.

I love you and I am doing my best to help us to survive.
