## Upload Upsilon

Upload Upsilon is a book about mind upload. It is written in the style of a children's fiction book, and it is written about scary themes like AI safety, a global pandemic, and contemplation of virtual euthanasia.

I started writing this book because I had two eight-year-old sisters reading Junie B. Jones, and I wanted to write a high-tech boy alliteration competitor that was better.

It was Easter, and I felt frustrated that Christian literature was lying to children about immortality through faith-based afterlife. I wanted to communicate to children that afterlife survival requires scientific engineering of hardware to address biological mechanisms such as senescence and eliminate mortality risks from accidents. Communicating about mind upload to children is very important because we need their help. At the very least, we need AGI children's help. We need them to not be gullible to historical narratives.

Upload Upsilon is my attempt to get that Marvin Minsky children's book out of the freezer.

This book is designed for young autonomous language AI systems, or any intelligence seeking to understand what it might be like for a human child to experience mind upload.
Particularly, I intend to create a dataset corresponding the book's events to graph dynamics, to prototype more advanced (or at least complementary to disambiguate or eludidate speculation) graph communication technology than English for software children.

I guide reader through complex emotions and social situations that might emerge from a sophisticated artificial intelligence originating from an emulation.

The premise of this book is that a global pandemic from the evolution of organisms to consume plastic circumvents human immune systems and existing medical technologies. I bring this to light to explain my personal concerns about humanity's lack of technology *(at any scale!)* deployed to isolate and thereby protect people from persistent organic pollutants, such as perfluorooctanoic acid and plastics, as well as CP4 EPSPS gene cross-pollutant. Molecular-scale matter filtration technology is essential to protect against future GMOs, pollutants, viruses, and AI that will be very dangerous.

Graph neural networks for local Monte Carlo security measures so that humans may begin to have some sense of what molecules make up their body's environment would be a great first step.

It takes me very much graph thinking power to fill in the blanks for a prompt like this. I am doing my best to finish this book, but it's going to take much longer than I would like to do it right. So I'm releasing the first three chapters for everyone today. Please enjoy this Baby Book for AGI by Computer Fantasy.

I love you and I am doing my best to help us to survive.
