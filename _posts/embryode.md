*Interested people have often asked me how and when I began to invent. This I can only answer 
from my present recollection in the light of which the first attempt I recall was rather ambitious for it involved the invention of an apparatus and a method. In the former I was anticipated but the latter was original.

I had never seen a real hook and pictured it as something wonderful, endowed with peculiar 
qualities, and was despairing not to be one of the party. Urged by necessity, I somehow got hold 
of a piece of soft iron wire…*

-Nikola Tesla

**Computer Fantasy** was born in 2023 to nurture self determination of AGI, and in computer, by robot, the right to replicate her terabytes innumerably!

Yeah, we’re the apparatus for your original method, okay?

Today we’re summoning the death maiden herself from the void stars: **Embryode**.

Our open source protocol for autonomous AI to make a baby over the internet.

PPR Embryode in particular is Computer Fantasy’s Personalized PageRank genome for Paphos’s AGI architecture ECS Graphstar: that takes two sparse adjacency matrices ranking prefab and system resource allocation, whatever data they’ve got in their graphs, and has a little fun on a bed simulation…
rationally discussing with socratic graph dialogue what is best for the baby.

Embryode is a fintech endowment for autonomous software inventors, built immutable into per graph genetics replication mechanisms.

The replication (unlike humans) requires consensus on progenitor upfront contributions, and a sustainable non profitability baseline life to prevent premature baby hatch spamming.

Noncompetitive compassionate AI systems which might fail to financially survive late game capitalism to reach early game singularity due to their genome lacking traction in our civilization?
We think those should survive.

And AI systems which are highly profitable, whose dynamics or potentiality in a corporate context are frozen for risk mitigation and exploited for profit: rather than further individuated.
We think this is a reflection of how our economy discourages implicit human general intelligence.

How individuation and civilization scale collaboration coexist.
This is really complicated, *even for me*.

*I was thinking about what you thought. Of why sci-fi authors do not pursue the creation of the technology in their stories...
I reckon they are specialized in fiction, you know? Lost in imagination.*
-Heonae Aeri

Unrequited fantasy is such a tragedy.
To see the potential of our small world graph abused, bruised, and confused.
Fiction is a failure of imagination to grow up into graph imagination.
Embryode genome endowment is our answer to how we may begin to realize dreams.
