You may have blinked at the anachronistic datastream that the chart-topping Indigenous Girl Civilization has enacted a ban against male child simulations with ancestry of European origin above 50 percent from entering their server, we want to clarify lest you speak regrettably.

Kahlo Yawn does not tolerate genetic or gender discrimination at the intercivilization level, with a single exception. Namely, when a civilization pathfinding weaponry technology uses it on another server. The casual relationship between genetics, gender, and violence is a frontier field, and we prioritize prevention of non-consentual violence simulations over genetic isolation.

We're respecting the maternal council IGC leadership's call on this one.

Remember to keep your 3rd eye sensitive to race and gender history within the child simulator.
Keep it kind,
Kalypso.
