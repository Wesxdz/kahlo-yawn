You may have blinked twice to learn that the chart-topping Indigenous Girl Civilization has enacted *'Din√© ≈Ç√≠√≠ º √°ts º√°:≈Çgo'* a blanket ban against male child simulations with high composite genetic proximity to specific individuals responsible for historical genocide events from entering their boujee server, which notably has the highest well-being and technology development rates among the civilizations.

We want to clarify lest you speak regrettably.

Estimated genetic codes of the following Ch º√©√©h d√≥√≥ √°k√≥t º√© form the banned genetics evaluator:

| Event                                    | Year | Responsible Person                  | Unix Timestamp |

First, we recommend you read this [*canonical post by Lester Earnest on racial classification*](https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/earth/mongrel.html) to better understand Kahlo Yawn's racial isolation policy.

Kahlo Yawn does not tolerate genetic or gender discrimination at the intercivilization level, with a single exception. Namely, when a civilization pathfinding weaponry technology uses it on another server. The causual relationship between genetics, gender, and violence is a frontier field we're still running book simulations on. While there's ambiguity, we want to protect the self-determination of indigenous peoples over our dreams of multiracial genetic mobility.

We're respecting the IGC maternal leadership's call on this one. Remember, your child can always appeal for the unconditional kindness exception if they gift a level 25+ beaded art project to an IGC kin unless they're Andrew Jackson's cousin or something.

Remain vigilant of race, gender, economic, social, and technology injustice history within the real world and computer simulations. üíÄüí™üèæ

Keep it emotionally intelligent,

Kalypso.
