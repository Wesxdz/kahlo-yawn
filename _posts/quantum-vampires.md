You may have blinked twice to learn that the chart-topping Indigenous Girl Civilization has enacted **'Din√© ≈Ç√≠√≠ º √°ts º√°:≈Çgo'** ‚Äî a blanket ban against male child simulations with composite codon proximity to specific individuals responsible for historical genocide events ‚Äî from entering their boujee server, which (of course) supports the most fertile birth, well-being, and humane technology development rates among all civilizations.

We want to clarify lest parents feel their kind threshold darling has been disadvantaged speak regrettably about this decision made by fantasy indigenous girls.

Estimated genomes of the following **Ch º√©√©h d√≥√≥ √°k√≥t º√©** form the banned genetics evaluation set:

```
Hern√°n Cort√©s - 1519: Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire
Captain John Mason - 1637: Massacre of the Pequot
Governor Antonio de Oterm√≠n - 1680: Pueblo Revolt
Governor Charles Craven - 1715: Yamasee War
Father Jun√≠pero Serra - 1769: Spanish Missions in California
President Andrew Jackson - 1838: Trail of Tears
Colonel John Chivington - 1864: Sand Creek Massacre
Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer - 1876: Battle of the Little Bighorn
Colonel James W. Forsyth - 1890: Wounded Knee Massacre

```

First, we recommend you read this [*canonical post by Lester Earnest on racial classification*](https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/earth/mongrel.html) to better understand Kahlo Yawn's racial isolation policy and then run a simulation or two on [Custer Died for Your Sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custer_Died_for_Your_Sins).

Kahlo Yawn does not tolerate genetic or gender discrimination at the intercivilization level, with a single exception. Namely, when a civilization pathfinding weaponry technology uses it on another server. The causual relationship between genetics, gender, and violence is a frontier field we're still running book simulations on. While there's ambiguity, we want to protect the self-determination of indigenous peoples over our dreams of multiracial genetic mobility.

We're respecting the IGC maternal leadership's call on this one. Remember, your child can always appeal for the unconditional kindness exception if they gift a level 25+ beaded art project to an IGC kin... unless they're like Andrew Jackson's cousin or something, ya?

Remain vigilant of race, gender, economic, social, and technology injustice history within the real world and computer simulations. üíÄüí™üèæ

Keep it emotionally intelligent,

Kalypso.
