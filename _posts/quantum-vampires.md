You may have blinked twice at the anachronistic datastream that the chart-topping Indigenous Girl Civilization has enacted a ban against male child simulations with ancestry of European origin above 50 percent from entering their server, we want to clarify lest you speak regrettably.

Kahlo Yawn does not tolerate genetic or gender discrimination at the intercivilization level, with a single exception. Namely, when a civilization pathfinding weaponry technology uses it on another server. The causual relationship between genetics, gender, and violence is a frontier field we're still running book simulations on. While there's ambiguity, we want to prioritize prevention of non-consentual violence simulations over multiracial genetic mobility.

We're respecting the IGC maternal leadership's call on this one. Remember, your child can always appeal for the unconditional kindness exception if you donate $4000 of turquoise or gift a level 25+ beaded art project to an IGC kin.

Keep your 3rd eye sensitive to race, gender, economic, social, and technology injustice history within the child simulator.

Keep it emotionally intelligent,

Kalypso.
