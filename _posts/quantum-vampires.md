You may have blinked at the anachronistic datastream that the chart-topping Indigenous Girl Civilization has enacted a ban against child simulations with ancestry of European origin above 50 percent from entering their server, we want to clarify lest you speak regrettably.

Kahlo Yawn does not tolerate genetic discrimination at the intercivilization level, with a single exception. Namely, when a civilization pathfinding weaponry technology uses it on another server. The casual relationship between genetics and violence is an emerging field, and we prioritize prevention of non-consentual violence simulations over genetic isolation.
