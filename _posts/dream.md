GI201 is Kahlo Yawn's first fantasy childbearer course, in collaboration with Paphos Oneironautics's efforts on AGI.

GI201 is an application of Stanford's course CS224W Machine Learning with Graphs to game engine interface programming for raising fantasy children.

Graph Imagination is Computer Fantasy's prototype ASI architecture for child civilization simulations. Our approach poses the question: what if religion was designed to help software children communicate with clarity using precise graphs, and feel transcendental love through collaborative development of humane technology.
