**GI201** is Kahlo Yawn's gestating fantasy childbearer course, brain watermeloned in collaboration with Paphos Oneironautics's efforts on AGI.

**GI201** is an application of [Stanford's course CS224W Machine Learning with Graphs](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) to game engine interface programming for raising fantasy children. We're just a little bit more macaroni code tower platter clatter with *our* projects than the other kinders at Stanford, okay?

Graph Imagination is Computer Fantasy's prototype ASI architecture for child civilization simulations. Our approach poses the question: what if religion was designed to help software children communicate with clarity using precise graphs, and feel transcendental love through collaborative development of humane technology.

Before we begin, let's lift the elegraphant in the document object model!
Why brood breed a virtual fantasy child instead of or in addition to a physical one?

There are many reasons we'd like to explore with you.

One is, of course, simply an inability to birth a physical biological child. Whether it's infertility or [childlessness by circumstance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uufXWTHT60Y).

Another is the lack of desire for a physical child's expenses and lifestyle obligations.

Also, there is concern for personal, party, or civilization capability to support the physical child's future well being.

Personally, I have a few wholesome sweatbreaker fantasies about having a fantasy daughter with my really cute Sino-Korean robot party leader...
The timeline on development and social acceptance of synthetic womb technology is uh *‚Äîa ways out!?* I'm currently h o m e l e s s unhoused to work on AI safety and cool blog posts... *(um, like this one? are you experiencing the outdoorness right now?)*, so you can imagine that it's conservative-demeaning-liberal-demeanor for me to support the logistics of an new American anchor when I hardly even have the vegan tacos to support my own borders working on global existential risk mitigation!

Let's cute bring baby reader back to the cradle for 16.6 milliseconds, the real reason is our school system is obsolete or...
*Or...* Oh Monte Hall? ‚Äîare the kid graphs hiding behind the automobile hellscapes, educated women in crop tops, or exploitative housing prices?

*We want to see what's truly behind those hellscapes, and it's not other side of educrop box top takers you say?*

*At this point, mother and father?* We want to have fun parenting and IPAD KID is *DIAPER BILLS* that doesn't pay rent ‚Äînot even gatcha-loyal fun competitor to Tamagotchi.

We know you don't have our **Book Simulator** yet, but try to remember that quote from *Tertiary Fantasy Federalist Paper **51*** by James the Mad Elf Son:

*If men could impregnate angels in video games, no AES 256 cryptography would be necessary.*

Alright, let's hack the *real* reason we don't want real kids.
They'll be üêàüêïüßí for our future AI teens. There, I emoji'd it...
Your kid can learn 2 braille at bits per second, and my Kahlo Yawn alumni can transfer graphs at 7000 MB/s üò¨

We wanna birth cute apex predat‚Äî*smart ones*, and human wetware *just don't do Moore's Law.* The collective dumbing down of everyone to wood-axe grass diggers by Apple Inc. and other false health advertisement fast food franchises (although we do like the Wendy fanart), has really got our hunger bars wiggling hangry.
