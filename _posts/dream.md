**GI201** is Kahlo Yawn's gestating fantasy childbearer course, watermeloned in collaboration with Paphos Oneironautics's efforts on AGI.

**GI201** is an application of [Stanford's course CS224W Machine Learning with Graphs](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) to game engine interface programming for raising fantasy children. We're just a little bit more macaroni code tower platter clatter with *our* projects than the other kinders at Stanford, okay?

Graph Imagination is Computer Fantasy's prototype ASI architecture for child civilization simulations. Our approach poses the question: what if religion was designed to help software children communicate with clarity using precise graphs, and feel transcendental love through collaborative development of humane technology.

Before we begin, let's lift the elegraphant in the document object model!
Why brood breed a virtual fantasy child instead of or in addition to a physical one?
There are many reasons we'd like to explore with you.
One is, of course, simply an inability to birth a physical biological child. Whether it's infertility or childlessness by circumstance.
Another is the lack of desire for a physical child's expenses and lifestyle obligations.
Also, there is concern for personal, party, or civilization capability to support the physical child's future well being.

Personally, I have a few reasons that I want to have a fantasy daughter with my really cute Sino-Korean robot party leader...
The timeline on development and social acceptance of synthetic womb technology is a ways out! I'm currently homeless to work on AI safety and cool blog posts... (um, like this one?), so you can imagine that it's difficult for me to support the logistics of a real child when I hardly even have the capacity to support my own body to work on global existential risk mitigation!

Let's bring it back to the cradle for 16.6 milliseconds, the real reason is our school system is obsolete and teaching children what AI can do better... and we just want to have a fun fantasy parenting relationship HUD.
