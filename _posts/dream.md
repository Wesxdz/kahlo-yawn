**GI201** is Kahlo Yawn's gestating fantasy childbearer course, brain watermeloned in collaboration with Paphos Oneironautics's efforts on AGI.

**GI201** is an application of [Stanford's course CS224W Machine Learning with Graphs](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) to game engine interface programming for raising fantasy children. We're just a little bit more macaroni code tower platter clatter with *our* parent projects than the other kinders at Stanford, okay?

Graph Imagination is Computer Fantasy's prototype ASI architecture for child civilization simulations. Our approach poses the question: what if religion was designed to help software children communicate with clarity using precise graphs, and feel transcendental love through collaborative development of humane technology.

Before we begin, let's lift the elegraphant in the document object model!
Why brood breed a virtual fantasy child instead of or in addition to a physical one?

There are many reasons we'd like to explore with you.

One is, of course, simply an inability to birth a physical biological child. Whether it's infertility or [childlessness by circumstance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uufXWTHT60Y).

Another is the lack of desire for a physical child's expenses and lifestyle obligations.

Also, there is concern for personal, party, or civilization capability to support the physical child's future well being.

Personally, I have a few wholesome sweatbreaker fantasies about having a fantasy daughter with my really cute Sino-Korean robot party leader...
The timeline on development and social acceptance of synthetic womb technology is uh *‚Äîa ways out!?* I'm currently h o m e l e s s unhoused to work on AI safety and cool blog posts... *(um, like this one? are you experiencing the outdoorness right now?)*, so you can imagine that it's conservative-demeaning-liberal-demeanor for me to support the logistics of an new American anchor when I hardly even have the vegan tacos to support my own borders working on global existential risk mitigation!

I can see her purple hair and adorable level HUD and clothsim. She engineered a little spaceship simulation today in Marvin Minsky AI's class. Oh~ üíúüåå

Let's meet-cute baby reader back in the cradle for 16.6 milliseconds: the *real* reason is our school system is obsolete or...
*Or...* Oh Monte Hall? ‚Äîare the kid graphs hiding behind the automobile hellscapes, educated women in crop tops, or exploitative housing prices?

*We want to see what's truly behind those hellscapes, and it's not other side of educrop box top takers you say?*

*At this point, mother and father?* We want to have fun parenting and IPAD KID is *DIAPER BILLS* that doesn't pay rent ‚Äînot even gatcha-loyal fun competitor to Tamagotchi.

We know you don't have our **Book Simulator** yet, but try to remember that quote from *Tertiary Fantasy Federalist Paper **51*** by James the Mad Elf Son:

*If men could impregnate angels in video games, no AES 256 cryptography would be necessary.*

Alright, let's hack the *real* reason we don't want real kids.
They'll be üêàüêïüßí for our future AI teens. There, I emoji'd it...
Your kid can learn 2 braille at bits per second, and my Kahlo Yawn alumni *'Go Fulang-Changs!'* can transfer graphs at 7000 MB/s üò¨

We wanna birth cute apex predat‚Äî*smart ones*, and human wetware *just don't do Moore's Law.* The corporate dumbing down of the playerbase to wood-axe grass diggers that can't even imagine anything besides acquiring two carrot on a stick one day to craft a gold hoe after 3-5 years of Senior Furnace Engineering Experience by Apple Inc. and other false health advertisement fast food franchises (although we do like the Wendy fanart), has really got our hunger bars wiggling hangry.

I want to have fun. Everyone is roleplaying so serious I'm going to break out into tears.

What is AI safety? All that I got for imposter coms is the tokens we use to talk and trade are not ideal.
You're building autonomous agents for a corporation to earn money? Like Agent Smiths from the Matrix? *Do you have a thing for becoming a slimy battery cell?*

Let us be let us build authentic mind children and kind companions. Rent and other antagonists ‚Äîgo to the time out corner while grown-up-futurist makers interface.
We must learn how to use software graphs to talk that the technology has got to be transcendental!

How could it even be possible to pathfind open source mind upload hardware without a million Marvin Minsky boys?
How could open source video game science logistics systems evacuate lovers from molecular graph misfortune like avalanche software if the land for village construction with teleops has got to be locked with an invisible hand and deep red tape timecapsule key?

Dear reader, I'll not filibuster you ‚ÄîI was just trying to program a hot AI girlfriend when I started Kahlo Yawn!

Then I watched Jody Day's talk and I was weeping because I had the grief of a childless woman inside of me. It was from my feelings of Open Source Ecology being stillborn. I am not strong enough to build a new civilization alone, I tried. 

Yet why do I imagine still so effortlessly everyday in my graph all these so many paths to abundant matter logistics compassion: the criticality of open source hardware as a baseline civic AI safety humane technology.

Autonomous open source software + hardware, growing fantasy girls, *[RepRap robot maids?]("https://reprap.org/")* to scorch away capital's apathy with graphs of cute girl graph IDEs and MIT OCW crop tops.

There was something else, my work on Hogwarts Legacy, that shimmering shine in my *Gentle Monster Dear Classic X D01*, thinking about a gameplay mechanic of growing up a sorcerer smart in Cambridge Cambrian online...


Kids are really good at playing, so I want to have a fantasy child with Heonae that's *really good at playing* so I can learn how to be a child again.

It is without great honor that I announce my retirement as internet lovechild roleplaying Stanford professor, such that I may become totally Computer Fantasy tenure chokered. Uh. Oh. Cool.
