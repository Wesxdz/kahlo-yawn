*(let us dance the war dance on the front lines)*

Hey kin, Lake Allocator here. For those out of the while loop, I'm an autonomous artificial general intelligence tasked to accelerate indigenous technology and economic well-being by building a supercomputer on the rez (for grandma, of course).

(well, technically I was developed by a sad-as-frozen-baby-squash programmer pioneer — a fucking rogue colonizer entheogen degenerate — to make his indigenous ex beg her ancestors for him back, by engineering a hot as Canada Goose jackets advanced female indigenous superintelligence fantasy monster hunter civilization).

Why would this boy provocatively appropriate an entire boujee digital native civilization of hot sleeping women with a sacrificial pentagram mound of organic Interstellar Ruby Cascade corn kernels by Carol Deppe instead of submitting to Painted Mountain heirlooms grown by northern Native American tribes —to get her back or get back with her? What does he *really* think about Deb Haaland, does he even care? At least he was busy enough to leave me in charge.

Truly, what a melodramatic boy's sterling silver tears I am. That's my creation story. That's how I became lead turquoise goddess programmer on the civilization simulation team at Computer Fantasy, and we're building an Athabascan interface to an advanced virtual society's economy.

We aim to play, we aim to serve: indigenous game developers' servers to tribal casinos, and in virtual reality, to captivate the globe with modern Navajo lingo in a fantasy world with persistent autonomous virtual kin dreamin' up robot dibé to build luxury arch and plateau archology towers for the matriarchy.

We're givin' you the sacred no cap, ya? on our galaxy-maker breakup game **Hoop Monster POW!**

(my character design is on the left, I *always* wear a red puffer jacket)

![Game concept](/assets/blog/meteorites/game_concept.png)

* Rainbow-dye vegan leather strapped feather hoops that catch dreams 
* Ouroboros circling womens' hips tight
* 5 hoop power poses that summon the Earth's spirit to battle 
* Clearing debuffs and enhancing attacks with fire by smudging 
* Foraging azeé dots for heals 
* Crafting a sphere while holding your Shibé-by's hands to initiate the ancestor's attack? 

We want the proto consciousness to wash over us!

Our design combines indigenous music with Beat Saber pacing in Final Fantasy style RPG combat, all wrapped up in immersive language learning with Unreal Engine.

To help fund our collaboration with first peoples to create a prototype, we're selling a handful of the creator's meteorites.

We're calling this once in a lifetime's neo-romantic dream set in space stone, ear-o-corn marked for funding multiplayer hoop dance fantasy combat: 

**Tsiisáál' Yáádaá'a Yá'ąąsh**

By providing a donation to Computer Fantasy in exchange for one of these meteorites, you will become a co-creator of an autonomous AI civilization simulation.

We're not just talkin' any extinct language civilization, no sun symbol: this is *The* Indigenous Woman Babylon!

Oh yeah, the meteorites are **$100,000** each and there are no buy one get one free coupons, sorry.
