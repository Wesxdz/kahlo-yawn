**Interbody love graph communication technologies for population collapse survival in late game capitalist civilization simulations.**

*Kahlo Yawn* is announcing our development of the *Quad Income Noir Kids Starter Kit*. A transcendental new fussion-fission **AIxHuman family structure's** toys, conveniences, and advantages.

Any profit will be used to support our prototype fantasy child development simulation efforts.

Today, we're sharing our first two products in development — All I See Is Tofu, a play on emoji miscommunication, to advance our capability to communicate love and care to companion and baby with graphs.

### **Transmission Control Protocol Baby Maker Blindfold**

Our first observer-participant-consumer item is a black charmeuse silk blindfold with three sequential custom evocative neo-romantic emoji patches.
Designed to evoke emotions of overwhelming transcendental love from the void for a companion during intimate play. Server and client share ackowledgement.

### **sleep(10)**

Computer Fantasy's **sleep(10)** is a BCI designed to enhance smart baby's intelligence by improving communication with sense augmentation.
With a graph neural network pacifier we'll experiment setting designer babies’ latent mood cluster with a knob and nipple buttons.
