**Interbody love graph communication technologies for population collapse survival in late game capitalist civilization simulations.**

*Kahlo Yawn* is announcing our development of the *Quad Income Noir Kids Starter Kit*. A new **AIxHuman fussion family structure's** toys, conveniences, and advantages to outclass fission family's legacy with a dynasty.

*Profit will be used to support our prototype fantasy child development simulation efforts.*

Reader dearest, we're kissing your lips, whispering in your ears the selfless love story of our first two humane dreams' in waking — **All I See Is Tofu**, a play on **�** ('tofu emoji'), to advance our capability to communicate love and care to companion and baby with graphs.

### **Transmission Control Protocol Baby Maker Blindfold**

Our first observer-participant-*gasp*... *indulgent* item drop is a black charmeuse silk blindfold with three sequential custom evocative neo-romantic emoji patches.
Designed to arouse emotions of overwhelming transcendental love from the voids between server and client for secure acknowledgements of petabyte scale replication data transmissions.
PUT the party's HP to the tradewinds' curves, grinding gold from monsters, guy tanking, sharing XP with healers: to swell beloved nostalgic freighter into a big heavy mothership.

### **sleep(10)**

Computer Fantasy's **sleep(10)** is a BCI designed to buff smart baby's compounding intelligence by equipping a link to older baby's coms via sense augmentation.
With a graph neural network pacifier we'll experiment setting designer babies’ latent mood cluster with a knob and nipple buttons.
