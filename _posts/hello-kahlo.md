## Swipe Right to barter Genetic Traits
You want a prodigy in quantum physics, they want a seastead captain to cross the Pacific ocean. 
Remember, it's a trade only if your co-progenitor swipes right too.
Negotiations can be intense, so collaboration is key in this genetic patchwork to hatch a theoretical physicist with a superluminal butterfly stroke.

The sim doesnâ€™t just throw nucleotides at you; it sneakily teaches you the ethics of parenting. Youâ€™ll find yourself pondering, "Should I enhance this trait? or is that going too far?" and
"What civilization server is best for my fantasy child's adolescence?"

Hereâ€™s where it gets spicy. Sometimes, the simulator spills a mutation for fun. Perhaps your virtual offspring programs blue noise into prophetic visions or animates underwater basket weavers in Blender.

Whether you decide to dabble in genetic engineering, hone in on automated ASI research, or earnestly cultivate a humble sapien from selfies or DNA of consenting parents: we're here to simulate them for you, and ensure continued life and purpose for them if you die or need to disconnect for a while.
