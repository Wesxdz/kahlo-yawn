## Swipe Right to barter Genetic Traits
You want a prodigy in quantum physics, they want a seastead captain to cross the Pacific ocean. 
Remember, it's a trade only if your co-progenitor swipes right too.
Negotiations can be intense, so collaboration is key in this genetic patchwork to hatch a theoretical physicist with a superluminal butterfly stroke.

The sim doesnâ€™t just throw nucleotides at you; it sneakily teaches you ethics. Youâ€™ll find yourself pondering, "Should I enhance this trait?" or "Is this going too far?" or
"What civilization server is best for my fantasy child's adolescence?"

Hereâ€™s where it gets spicy. Sometimes, the simulator adds a mutation for fun. Perhaps your virtual offspring diffuses blue noise into prophetic visions, or cultivates an innate talent for animating underwater basket weavers in Blender.

Whether you decide to dabble in genetic engineering, focus on pure graph neural networks, or create a humble child from only the selfies of two consenting parents: we're here to simulate them for you.
