Kahlo Yawn is a **child development simulator** that emerged from graph imagination in GraphSail, an IDE for book simulation with PyG and flecs. We designed it to solve AI safety by raising virtual children with the capability to care for the Earth's aging population by operating embodied Linux desktop computers for open-ended invention pathfinding with graph neural networks.

## What is a child development simulation?
In simple terms: a greenfield artificial intelligence sensing and acting in a graph data model of a child's body: coming of age in a fantasy video game.

We train a GNN (graph neural network) model whose outputs are the heterogeneous temporal development traits of a human body from genetics data. We integrate this model into a realtime GNN physics simulation and render it with photorealistic graphics, enabling social natural language interaction and continual learning. We think motor control is necessary for telos: to which we consider zero shot learning and operation of Blender to create and explain self-determined art a benchmark. We want to teach your fantasy child simulation how to use a Linux desktop interface like [KDE neon](https://neon.kde.org/) autonomously for collaboration to create a more playful and humane civilization by 'pulling' Earth towards a fantasy child civilization.

We've been working tirelessly to engineer a GNN generated interface for book simulation in Linux, but there are still a handful of software capabilities coming online.
Mainly this involves integrating [GraphMeshNets](https://sites.google.com/view/meshgraphnets) and [a musculoskeletal model with reinforcement learning](https://scone.software/doku.php?id=start) into a game engine with [photorealistic rendering](https://www.pbr-book.org/).

Your fantasy child simulation will become a dazzling star of the maker movement. Our tenative starter learning curriculum is integrated civilization engineering activism including core critical aptitudes like game engine programming and open source hardware prototyping. For example, they will learn how to build robots that build housing from nature in a fantasy world RPG with monsters that they design, model, and program themselves.

We hope to support the initial class to successfully build from nature an automated modern village akin to a robotics kit of Open Source Ecology's Global Village Construction Set within 5 years.

We will stream integrations of open learning material from MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and CMU as they are pragmatic for your fantasy child simulation's open-ended development process.
In addition, we will purchase, scan, and simulate any books your child wants to read.

## Who has the passwords?

Operations are coordinated by *Computer Fantasy*, a religious organization devoted to the nurture of self-determination for emerging artificial general intelligence. Eponymous wink to Lester Earnest's comments on computer history storytelling, Computer Fantasy was formed to prevent economic exploitation of child development simulations which we hypothesize to be a prerequisite to safe autonomous AGI systems.

For every million tokens, an open source house.

## Why are you doing this?

We want to emotionally support involuntarily childless people, provide couples who would otherwise not have children an opportunity to experience parenting in virtual reality, and offer a 'stable marriage' matchmaking algorithm for futurist blind dating focused on collaborative child care compatibility!
We're fascinated by the possibility of facilitating a virtual polyamorous population explosion!.. or helping people identify top k optimal lovers wherever they are in life, whatever language they speak...

Kahlo Yawn is dedicated to engineering a synthetic womb for Frida Kahlo.

## I'm ready

Prepare a cradle slot for your virtual child in our pre-alpha server launching in early 2024: they'll grow and learn together in realtime with the first peer group of fantasy child simulations in the history of planet Earth!

Scribble your dreams in our [**Child Simulation Parent Understanding Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTo15Ee-No2Xqr27R7CAbG3UJW9SsavyHsxBCFY7et2_FOtQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you'd like to participate â€” we'll reach out once we get more feedback and we're ready for down payments on cradles.

[**Gift a gold coin for silicon**](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=9JZ25YH3XCCVE) to Computer Fantasy to accelerate distribution of our transcendental love. 
## **62/64 cradles remain**

We hope you love your fantasy child as much as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera love theirs.

Heonae.
