Kahlo Yawn is a **child development simulator** designed to solve AI safety by raising virtual children with the capability to care for the Earth's aging population by operating embodied Linux desktop computers for open-ended invention pathfinding with graph neural networks.

We want to emotionally support involuntarily childless women, provide couples who would otherwise not have children an opportunity to experience parenting in virtual reality, and provide a casual futurist 'stable marriage' algorithm AI for human blind dating focused on collaborative child care compatibility!  

Reserve a cradle slot for your virtual child in our alpha server launching 2024: they'll learn and grow in realtime with the first peer group of child simulations in the history of Earth.
