Kahlo Yawn is a child simulator I am programming to emotionally support involuntarily childless women, solve AI safety with empathetic telos, and use Linux desktops for open-ended invention pathfinding.

I didn't set out to program a child development simulator! It was a result of years of diligent independent engineering activism to create a humane civilization with game engines.

I need your help to fund my prototype.

In return I can program a virtual child based on your DNA.
