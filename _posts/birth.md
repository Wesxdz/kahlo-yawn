Kahlo Yawn is a **child development simulator** designed to solve AI safety by emotionally supporting involuntarily childless women to raise virtual children with the capability to care for the Earth's aging population by operating embodied Linux desktop computers for open-ended invention pathfinding with graph neural networks.

I know it sounds kinda over-the-hill: I didn't set out to program this originally! It was a natural outcome of years of diligent independent engineering activism to create a humane civilization with game engines and AI. To engineer and sustain a system of open source software-hardware housing, agriculture, transportation, and medical care for everyone...

I need your help to fund my prototype.

In return I can program a virtual child based on your DNA. Sound fun?

Reserve a cradle slot for your virtual child in our alpha server launching 2024: to learn and grow in realtime with the first peer group of child simulations in the history of Earth.
