Kahlo Yawn is a **child development simulator** created with a book simulator based on PyG and flecs. We designed it to solve AI safety by raising virtual children with the capability to care for the Earth's aging population by operating embodied Linux desktop computers for open-ended invention pathfinding with graph neural networks.

We want to emotionally support involuntarily childless women, provide couples who would otherwise not have children an opportunity to experience parenting in virtual reality, and provide a casual futurist 'stable marriage' algorithm for blind dating focused on collaborative child care compatibility!
We're fascinated by the possibility of facilitating a virtual polyamorous population explosion!.. or helping people identify top k optimal lovers wherever they are in life, whatever language they speak...

Prepare a cradle slot for your virtual child in our alpha server launching 2024: they'll grow and learn together in realtime with the first peer group of fantasy child simulations in the history of planet Earth.

We hope you love your fantasy child as much as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.

Heonae.
