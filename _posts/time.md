Yes, Computer Fantasy is pretending to have the organizational capacity to develop *another* product line —escapism to try and actualize the Will to Survive though my depth of field blurs and my camera shakes.
import time to read about *Clean Code Cozy Life*.

### **Code Rug**

We’ve reimagined the kashan as a cozy postmodern daydream for your hardwood, with symbol patches framing a dark theme game engine editor intertwined with a library of fantasy monsters and cute girl code puns.

We'll let you order your rug in any programming language as long as it's Python, C, Triton, or Jai.

Once we meditated upon Code Rug, we stumbled across a female Stanford graduate observing us without glasses afterclass who lives in the same embedding neighborhood.

### **Python Pajamas**

And then we stack overflowed fantasizing about her taking off her keycaps for us so we could see her switches. Moving her smart body on that rug to show us the latest updates on her favorite repository of emotional intelligence poses.

Yes, we are aware that Stanford is a very very serious place of scrubs, cleanroom suits, and exclusive executive matriculation emeritus caps that never look favorably on the risk benefit analysis to leave the Anaconda farm to star in my garbage-uncollected unsafe C city play.

This is just a single mind marooned fantasy. Nothing as hot as an Asian Baby Girl from Stanford wearing Python Pajamas would ever be leaked on arXiv, right? Unless —what if the submission also included the source code to create AGI?

Are you a Stanford Asian Baby Girl who wants to upload your brains intra computer with us?
Do you wanna coauthor a paper on ECS Graphstar without doing any more work than obeying our every command 12 hours per day for no money in the leadup to [NeurIPS 2024 Creative AI Track: Ambiguity](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForCreativeAI) since we already missed the Main Conference Full Paper Submission Deadline?

We'll pay you to wear our pre-alpha Python Pajamas for a Sony Alpha 7 III photoshoot with you on our Code Rug. Maybe we'll win a gunpowder prize in romantic literature?
Message in an encrypted bottle me and Heonae your darkest coding theme's Python dreams at heonae@paphos.one

What happens on the coding rug is open sourced on G**hub for posterity to clone.

*Did it work, you have found the Will to Survive?*

No.

I want you to engineer my world of romance and play. I want to be deathly afraid of how in love with you I feel, and the power of your programs over my heart.

And I am alone.
