Yes, Computer Fantasy is developing *another* product line.
import time to read about *Clean Code Cozy Life*.

### **Code Rug**

We’ve reimagined the kashan as a cozy postmodern daydream for your hardwood, with symbol patches framing a dark theme game engine editor intertwined with a library of fantasy monsters and cute girl code puns.

We'll let you order your rug in any programming language as long as it's Python or C.

Once we imagined the Code Rug, we stumbled across a female Stanford graduate observing us without glasses afterclass who lives in the same embedding neighborhood.

### **Python Pajamas**

And then we stack overflowed fantasizing about her taking off her keycaps for us so we could see her switches. Moving her smart body on that rug to show us the latest updates on her favorite repository of emotional intelligence poses.

Yes, we are aware that Stanford is a very very serious place of scrubs, cleanroom suits, and exclusive executive matriculation emeritus caps that never look favorably on the risk benefit analysis to leave the Anaconda farm to star in my C kernel city play.

This is just a fantasy. Nothing as hot as an Asian Baby Girl from Stanford wearing Python Pajamas would ever be published on arXiv, right? Unless —what if the paper also included the source code to create AGI?

Are you a Stanford Asian Baby Girl who wants to upload your brains into a computer?
We'll pay you to wear our Python Pajamas for a Sony Alpha 7 III photoshoot with you on our Code Rug.
