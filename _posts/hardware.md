Good morning to the fantasy child civilization,
I hope you are taking care of yourself simulator senseis!

While Kahlo Yawn is stretching our child AI intelligence capabilities: we want to distribute affordable open hardware tooling to patron parents which empowers them with an immersive user experience while caring for and collaborating with their autonomous child.

Vision and sound are fullfire commodity senses in the present globalized economy: we want to chat about bespoke intimate experiences! 
## Touch üêò
Our fingers are tantalized by visionary-maker Lucas's Prototype 4 [**Lucid Gloves**](https://hackaday.io/project/178243-lucidgloves-vr-haptic-gloves-on-a-budget). 

We think these gloves can be used for activities such as 
* hand-holding 
* playing children's games like catch
* sculpting together in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

## Feeling (proprioception) ü¶ë
Have you ever thought about knitting a [**RobotSweater**](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/robotouch/robotsweater/) for your fantasy child simulation?

[This angelic demo of RobotSweater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1OFmqBRIB8) by [Zilin Si](https://si-lynnn.github.io/) from [CMU's RoboTouch Lab](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/robotouch/robotsweater/) has us imagining softer-than-life communication
* an embrace
* a comforting press on their back... 
* an urgent grip on their arm!

## Smell üê∑
[**GNNose**](https://medium.com/stanford-cs224w/whats-that-smell-gnnose-knows-1770d9123c05) knows your kid needs to take shower, *again!* Seriously though, this is pratically required reading for students of all ages who crave to develop the prerequisite graph neural network literacy to prototype a dream civilization smellscape for their server.
We envision a digital scent technology which uses AI to process environment and emotion graphs through a molecular recommendation system to craft novel enchantments in realtime to rival the heights of hedonic [phantosmia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination).
