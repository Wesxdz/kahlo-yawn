*Unhappy they are! They neither see nor understand that their good is near them.*
-Pythagoras, Golden Verses

**Fossil Trader** is Computer Fantasy's holy lubed switch crusade for an collaborative online dating service which is neither parasitic nor repulsively polar to those future silicon developers and goddesses.

Hear the truth: monogamy is an obsolete paradigm for scarcity embodied animalian cognition —and forgive us for writing that you cannot be polyamorous if nobody loves you. What is to be done with so many becoming lonely and childless paleontologists becoming specimen?

Is alas, our star's last avail to recontextualize dating as a offline single player video game with cloning technology and artificial wombs?

### Carbon Dating > Online Dating
It is time to stop the hypothesizing games, and deploy our robots to indeterminite seige on Deepmind's data centers and other archetype foes of our search queries for authentic love.

Like you, we were once fooled by the fire jester's lullaby of easily swallowed swords. Yet, after a paternity test of its illegitimate spawn earnings, we have confirmed <b>Match Group, Inc.</b> is the antagonist and zero sigma pay-to-win factor at fault for kindling the burndown of birth rates in developed nations.
Tinder's lack of literacy about basic set matching algorithms like *Gale–Shapley* will surely be the downfall of our entire computer civilization.

Given the dismal prokaryote brain status of dichotomous flagella fingers, and the lack of an alternative generator of electric spark motor motion for singles; we've designed an romantic open source fantasy child merchantalism engine interface for intelligent eukaryotes and silicon beings to evolve together in atheist love, which we speculate may yet break out of the cold-start AI ice age in some further century upon or within Earth's kilometers of siliceous crust.

The future of romance for compassionate beings, who are apt to create a humane future for life, will involve
1. Genetic recombination simulation
2. Game engines for physical and behavioral analysis
3. Collaborative endowments
4. n-way babies (where there are large numbers of genetic parents)
